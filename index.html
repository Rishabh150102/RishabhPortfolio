    <!-- Projects -->
    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Self Driving Car Simulation: - <br>We used Udacity software for data collection and then auto-drive the car on the same path. We used CNN, tensorflow, keras for our training and data augmentation. 2 x 2, 3 x 3, 5 x 5 kernel was used.</li>
        <li>Skin Cancer Classification: - <br>We used 10,000 images of skin cancer of 7 different types. The VGG16, Xception and CNN model was used. We used Z-score to normalize the features extracted from images. The highest accuracy of 82% was achieved in Xception model.</li>
        <li>Song Recommendation System: - <br>We have used machine learning algorithms to recommend the user song according to his/her previous listened song or playlist. We applied PCA, Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, Naïve Bayes. We achieved highest accuracy in Random Forest of 77%.</li>
    </ul>
